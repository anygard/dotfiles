# README

These are my dotfiles, Linux/UNIX CLI settings i prefer and want to bring with me. You are encouraged to use it for your self. It is recommended that you fork the repo and make any changes/improvements to there. It is then trivial to make a PR against my repo if you feel you have created something of general interest and utility.
